					<p>Fresh, quality produce, meat, dairy and buns, sourced from partners located just miles from our restaurants, are the ingredients to making the perfect burger. This commitment to creating the best possible food for our guests is a direct reflection of our promise of creating fast food burgers using slow food values.</p>
					<p>Bite into any Super burger, and taste the difference. Our burgers, fries, and shakes are made with the finest, freshest ingredients available.</p>
					<p>All our beef is Rockey Farms, humanely-raised, vegetarian-fed, ground fresh daily, and sourced from a family-owned ranch.</p>
					<p>All of our shakes and cones are made with organic cream from Rockey Creamery, a small, family-owned, organic farm located South of Nephi, Utah.</p>
					<p>Our buns are baked to our specification by an artisan baker in Nephi, UT</p>
					<p>The potatoes we use to make our French fries are made from potatoes grown in North America by growers who are required to identify the genetic source of their seed potatoes. We do not work with genetically modified potato varieties. Our potatoes are processed fresh off the field and delivered to us without any modifications. We proudly serve Sir Kensington ketchup.</p>
